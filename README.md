# PrivacyDashboard

This app brings Privacy dashboard features from Android 12 to older android devices.

Have you ever thought which apps are accessing your privacy permission without telling you?
Well! Now you don't have to, as Privacy dashboard will keep track of that.

App has simple and clear timeline view of accesses to location, microphone and camera.

This app mainly focuses on bringing features of "Privacy Dashboard" as seen in DP2 of android 12 to older devices.
